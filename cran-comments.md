## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is another try to submit `immundata`.
I fixed all the notes and warnings related to the package. There are some notes left
pointing to the potential misspellings of the terms in the DESCRIPTION, but those are
correct.

The CRAN check also points out that there is no `read_parquet_duckdb`, but it passes tests on my machine (I know, I know...),
and I added the reference to the package, and the resultant documentation links work. I hope this is fine.
Thank you!
